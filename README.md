# codeLearningExamples

## What's this about?

My second try on learning JS since late 2013. Basically I restarted with just a little notions left from last time. The goal here is to learn a certain style of JS code writing and learn ES6 with react.js and redux as the tool set. And I am experienting a new way to learn with Github and [Genius Beta](http://genius.com/beta). After installing its [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/genius-beta/ccaokncpmmjiakalbcfdbfmpcaiddjdn), you will be able to see my notes on the examples here.

My first attempt back in late 2013 included skimming some books: the good part, eloquent JS... and trying node.js.

My programming background by this started: objective-c, golang(wrote a server with Martini), swift, all at junior levels. So yes, there are some similarities amaong different languages that can provide me clearer context while learning. But still, I believe
