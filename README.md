# codeLearningExamples

## What's this about?

My second try on learning JS since late 2013. Basically I restarted with just a little notions left from last time. The goal here is to learn a certain style of JS code writing and learn ES6 with react.js and redux as the tool set.

My first attempt back in late 2013 included skimming some books: the good part, eloquent JS... and trying node.js.
